# Project 6 - *TranslateMe*
iOS app that translates between languages and allows users to store and delete their translations.

- [x] When users tap translate, the word written in the upper field translates in the lower field; you can only translate from one language to another
- [x] A history of translations can be stored (in a scroll view in the same screen, or a new screen)
- [x] The history of translations can be erased
- [x] Add a variety of choices for the languages
- [x] Add UI flair
- [x] Add button to conveniently switch languages
